# (OUTDATED) Remove-Clock-From-KDE-Lockscreen
Remove clock from KDE lockscreen to get a full view of wallpaper. Works for me in KDE Plasma 5.17.1 on Arch Linux 5.3.7.

It has been out of date cause now you can go to "System Settings" -> "Workspace Bahaviour" -> "Screen Locking" -> "Apperance" and untick "Clock"

Put LockScreenUi.qml under this location:

`/usr/share/plasma/look-and-feel/org.kde.breeze.desktop/contents/lockscreen` 

and overwirte

*Remember to backup*
